# cook-for-me

This project will eventually become a mobile recipe app, for us to scan in and upload recipes we have for more ease of access.

We have found that trying to shuffle through physical recipe cards to find something to make for dinner is pretty annoying, especially as we collect more and more recipes. The idea behind this app is that we will be able to sort recipes by cost and length of cooking time to find the perfect recipes for anytime during the week.
